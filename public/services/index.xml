      <description>Estate planning actually refers to the process required to transfer and preserve your estate in both an orderly and tax-effective manner.
The WILL forms the centerpiece of a well structured estate plan. The will gives clear direction as to how the assets will be distributed. The estate plan also focuses on the tax implications with a goal of minimizing and deferring taxes on death so that the estate can be preserved for its beneficiaries.</description>
